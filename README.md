## About the project

All objectives seems to work fine. For the output sent I sent in chunks, and other messages are loaded in memmory cause they
are small. I gave functions names that describe functionality as clear as possible and same for variables, used classes that
thay serve the use of their name, so I do not have too much to describe here, since the explanation of the project describes
with detail everything. Used Posix Api for socket handling and sync instead of C++ functions as was described in Piazza.
